Description: The motifStack package is designed for graphic 
             representation of multiple motifs with different similarity 
             scores. It works with both DNA/RNA sequence motif and amino 
             acid sequence motif. In addition, it provides the flexibility 
             for users to customize the graphic parameters such as the 
             font type and symbol colors.
